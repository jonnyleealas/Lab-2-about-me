            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <img src="img/_DSC6269.jpg" alt="jonny" width="300" >
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Jonathon Lee. When I'm asked about myself, I usually tell about having to move around most of my life. I've lived in several states and cities. I even I lived in El Salvador for a year when I was ten.
              Constantly moving helped me go to 15 schools before graduating high school! I sometimes refer to my family as a bunch of nomads; always moving around for a new place to live! However, I am thankful that I've experienced as much as I have. It's made me more adaptable. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I can tell about who I am is that I like making people laugh. I'm constantly trying to find a way to find humor in things. It's kind of a rush when a bit actually works and the whole room is laughing. There are times when I end up looking dumb and no one laughs, but that's the risk that you take!
              <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Last thing I'll talk about are some of the things that I'm into. I'm in a band. We've played shows thoughout Wa, and even toured a bit in the past years. We are currently working on our first album; which we've been working on for 3 years. I'm also into cooking. One of my favorite things to cook are Carbonara or Cacio pepe. When learning a recipe I'll usually cook the same thing each day for a few weeks! It sounds weird to people when I tell them I've been eating Carbonara for the past two weeks; but, how else will I learn how to cook it correctly? Last thing I'll say is that I love sneakers and jeans. I won't get too much into that; it'll take too long!

          <h2 id="jayl">Education</h2>
          <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>High School Diploma</li>
                  <li>Attended Austin Community College(one year)</li>
                  <li>Currently attending Code Fellows in Seattle Wa (Software Develpment)</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <h2> Goals </h2>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a few goals for the year that I'd like to accomplish. First on the list is to graduate from Code Fellows. I've put everthing on hold to get through courses 201, 301, and 401. I need to come out of this program as a full fledged Software Developer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbspIn my <strong>about me</strong> I mentioned that I was in a band. Another goal I have for the year is to finish our album. We are close. We should have it finished for release in July. That is another thing I have to juggle with, because music is a big portion of my life. If anyone is interested in checking us out, you can find us on <strong>instagram@alkimusic</strong> ! <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp Last goal I'll mention is to try an open mic for stand up. I've been on stage as a musician for years and that feels comfortable. However, being on stage where my only job is to create laughter is a different beast! I'm gonna do it; just haven't decided when.</p>
